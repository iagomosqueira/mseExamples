Some draft examples on the usage of FLR's mse package.

NOTE: This is work oin progress, aiming at developing fairly clean code for the different OM structures available in [mse](https://github.com/flr/mse).

- FLom: Single stock and single fleet OM, annual timestep.
- FLom_seasonal: Single stock and single fleet OM, seasonal timestep.
- FLombf_biol-fishery: Single stock (as FLBiol) and single fleet OM, annual timestep.
- FLombf_biol-fisheries: Single stock and multiple fleets, annual timestep.
- FLombf_biol-fisheries_seasonal: Single stock and multiple fleets, seasonal timestep.
- FLombf_biols-fisheries: Multiple stocks and multiple fleets, annual timestep.
- FLombf_biols-fisheries_seasonal: Multiple stocks and multiple fleets, seasonal timestep.
